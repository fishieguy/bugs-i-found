sometimes when i use the lashing potato (grappling hook) downwards and i am on a platform moved by a floatator, the grappling hook goes through the platform and usually gets stuck, i have proof in a png file
note

and for janky grapple movement, go to first person, use the lashing potato, and punch the air and you can see it moves in first person, but does not move in any third person

note: all this only happened to me on a singleplayer world, not a server so results may vary, or because other reasons the results may vary.
